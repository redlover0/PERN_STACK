# Yelp Clone - PERN Stack Project @ Google Code Next

## Overview
This project is a Yelp clone built using the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js). It was developed while following a YouTube tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01rYl9T3BU

## Features
- Restaurant listings with detailed information
- User reviews and ratings system

## Tech Stack
- **PostgreSQL**: Database for storing restaurant and user data
- **Express**: Backend API framework
- **React**: Frontend library
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment

## Challenges and Solutions
The original YouTube tutorial was outdated, which presented several challenges:

1. **Deprecated Libraries**: Many of the libraries used in the tutorial had newer versions with breaking changes or were completely deprecated.
   - **Solution**: Researched and implemented alternative libraries with similar functionality or adapted code to work with newer versions.

2. **React Hooks vs Class Components**: The tutorial used older class component patterns while modern React emphasizes hooks.
   - **Solution**: made components to use hooks and functional components.

## Key Learning Points
- Adapting to changing technologies and finding solutions when tutorials become outdated
- Troubleshooting dependency conflicts and version compatibility issues
- Working with database relationships in PostgreSQL
- State management in React applications
- Creating responsive UI with modern CSS approaches
